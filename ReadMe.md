# X0V OpenGL Voxel Engine

This repository documents my journey of continuing low-level graphics programming with OpenGL and C++ by creating a voxel engine including all the common functionality.

## Libaries

Libraries used currently:

- `glad` to receive OpenGL function pointers
- `glfw` to create and manage application windows with an opengl context on different platforms
- `glm` for vector and matrix calculations
- `stbi` to handle texture image loading
