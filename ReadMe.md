# X0V OpenGL Voxel Engine

This repository documents my journey in low-level graphics programming with OpenGL and C++, focusing on the creation of a general-purpose rendering engine. While the engine is currently applied to render voxels as part of a Minecraft-inspired project, its design and functionality aim to be flexible and extendable for various use cases.

## Libaries

Libraries used currently:

- `glad` to receive OpenGL function pointers
- `glfw` to create and manage application windows with an opengl context on different platforms
- `glm` for vector and matrix calculations
- `stbi` to handle texture image loading
